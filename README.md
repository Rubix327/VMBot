# VMBot v2.0
The bot that is automating the process of creating the virtial machines and downloading a browser through it.

Generally, the majority of the work the bot do is moving the cursor, clicking, scrolling and waiting for the appearence of the picture on the screen, on which it relies when working. These actions are available to be used by the PyAutoGUI framework.
Most of the logic code is written in the main.py. The big functions or frequently used functions are written in the other files (like functions.py or VPN_start.py). I tried to keep the structure of the code by formatting it like that.
